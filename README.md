# Personal Finance Manager Overview

This application is a simple yet powerful tool for individuals to manage their personal finances. As a software engineer, I developed this software to further my learning in Java and to provide a practical solution for users to track their spending, budget, and overall financial health. The application allows users to record transactions, categorize them, and view their financial data through various reports.

# Development Environment

The tools and technologies used in the development of this application include:

- **IDE:** JetBrains Rider
- **Java Version:** OpenJDK 11
- **Build Management:** Maven (if used, otherwise specify manual compilation process)
- **Version Control:** Git

The Java programming language was chosen for its object-oriented capabilities, ease of use, and widespread community support. No external libraries were used in the initial development phase, keeping the project straightforward and focused on core Java features.

# Features

The application provides the following features:

- Adding, editing, and removing financial transactions
- Categorizing transactions for better financial management
- Visualizing spending patterns with basic charts (to be implemented)
- Generating summary reports of monthly spending (to be implemented)
